# Parry

## What is Parry?

Parry is a web application and dashboard for managing your Dungeons & Dragons campaigns. This dashboard can be used by players to manage their own
characters, items, stats, etc... and by the Dungeon Master to also manage the players, monsters, map, quests, events, arcs, etc...

This is *not* a standalone application for playing Dungeons & Dragons. Parry was made to enjoy D&D in a hybrid setting, you have physical player pawns, a physical map
with your main locations, physical dice, physical effect rings, etc... and Parry is meant to supplement that by allowing you to more easily create characters, maps, etc...

#### Notice:

-
Parry was created for and optimized for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition 2014 Edition.
-

Now that was probably a pretty bad overall explanation. Here are all the features for you:

### Maps (Work in progress)

    Parry allows you to create macro-scale maps, meaning very zoomed out maps, of your entire world or region, but this is not made for individual
    towns or similar, as that should be physical.

### Character Sheets (Work in progress)

    You can create characters for D&D 5e (2014 & 2024) and 4e with ease. This also allows the Dungeon Master to manage players just to make sure
    nobody is cheating...

### Quests (Work in progress)

    Quests can be defined inside the DM Dashboard for tracking, players cannot see quests, of course.

### NPCs (Work in progress)

    You can track NPC stats, which include monsters. This also includes an inventory function for each NPC.

### Sessions (Work in progress)

    Sessions can be tracked and planned ahead of time. You can either start a session in real time, or, you can make it so it will start itself at a
    specific time and date. You can also use a calender in the dashboard for planning sessions with players. 

### Notifications (Work in progress)

    When in a session, the DM will receive notifications and details of all changes made by a player. For example, a player changes his/her health from 21 to 19, the DM
    will get a notification saying:

    {playerName}'s health has been decreased from 21 to 19.
    [ REVERT ]

    As you can see in the example, there is a revert button included, just in case the player was not supposed to change that value. Of course, the player can also revert
    that change themselves in their character management page.

## Future Features

So far, not a single one of these features above have been implemented, and if you look at the source code, you will see almost nothing. In the coming weeks and months,
many changes will be made to the codebase and files added and removed. This is a work-in-progress, and if you would like to contribute, 100% make a pull request
with your changes, which we will then review. If your changes are accepted, you will automatically be invited to be a collaborator.
